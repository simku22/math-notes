\textbf{Proposition R.231:}							% the Proposition number from the book (this one is fictitious)
Prove that $A = \left\{m + n\sqrt{3}\ |\ m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$ is closed under mulitplication.

\textbf{Proof:}              						% makes the word Proof bold face
Let $A = \left\{m + n\sqrt{3}\ |\ m,n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\},$ 
and let $m + n\sqrt{3}$ and $p + q\sqrt{3}$ be elements of $A$.
Then 
$$\eqn 
\left( m + n\sqrt{3} \right)\left(p + q\sqrt{3} \right) & = & mp + mq\sqrt{3} + np\sqrt{3}  + 3qn\\
																												& = & (mp + 3qn) + (mq + np)\sqrt{3}.\\    
																															  \eqnend$$
Since $m, n, p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$, $mp + 3nq$ and $ mq + np$ are both integers.  Therefore, 
$$\left( m + n\sqrt{3} \right)\left(p + q\sqrt{3}   \right) \in A,$$ 
and $A$ is closed under multiplication. \qed
